# Programming Club Overview
## Intro
```let programmingClub = {
    name: undefined,        // we need to decide on this
    description: 'A place where devs can learn and collaborate on projects',
    age: 1, // in years
    knownMemberCount: 3,    // let's hope more will join.....
    valueOf: () => 1/0
};
console.log(programmingClub);

// If you are lost rn, don't worry. You'll learn soon enough...
```

* Sorry I didn't write the entire page in code.

## Classes
Eventually, every team member will fall into _at least_ one of the following categories. There can be more than one of each, depending on the class, but there will be only one leader of each (if there's even one person).

- A **writer** creates the story (if necessary).
- A **designer** decides on aspects to the interface from the user to the story (if necessary).
- A **developer** makes the app or game work.
- An **artist** creates graphics for the app or game.
- A **musician** or **sound engineer** creates audio for the app or game.
- A **project manager** plans the making of the project in the real world.
- A **quality tester** makes sure the app or game is good.

## Ranks
Sometimes, there are multiple levels of difficulty within a class.

#### Developers
- Learners
  - Beginners
  - Need programming experience in order to contribute
  - Will spend time learning on various websites
  - When passed the ranking test, will advance to *Contributors*

- Contributors
  - Experienced
  - Work on projects

## Test
- You can take the test [here](https://www.testdome.com/tests/python-online-test/45).
- Proves that member...
  - Has basic understanding of core programming concepts, such as variables, functions, statements, scope, memory, types, OOP, etc.
  - Is willing to try to think through a problem.

## Projects
- [No limits]

## Contributing
- Push to the git repo. We'll use [GitHub](https://github.com) for most if not all open-source projects.

## Code of Conduct
See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Attendance
- Hosted Mondays & Fridays, 2:00-4:00
- Required minimum of once a week, unless there is a reasonable excuse.
- If required minimum is violated, then increment member's violation count. If violation count == `3`, then *warn* member. Else if violation count == `5`, disallow member to attend for one meeting. Else if violation count == `7`, we'll cross that bridge if we come to it, which I hope we won't.
